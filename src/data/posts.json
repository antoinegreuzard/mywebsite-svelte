The website fetches its data and generates the webpages at build time, and on runtime it simply serves the already generated webpages. I chose this approach because retrieving and parsing the climate data takes some time. The servers we fetch data from are fairly slow, and the data comes in as a CSV which needs to be parsed into JSON in order to be used in a JavaScript application.</p>\n",

The player will then either successfully dodge the balls, or experience a ‘hit’ resulting in a loss of 1 life. The game increases in difficulty the longer you play, and the score increases with time.

As part of my computer science degree, I worked on a box-office ticketing website for a local festival as a capstone project. Although my team was eager to start coding the project, it became clear that the hardest part would be understanding the client&#39;s expectations, specifying their requirements, and getting approval on designs. Redoing work due to misunderstood requirements, keeping track of multiple stakeholders, and getting final sign-off were just some of the challenges we faced over the course of the year.</p>\n<p>If you work in a digital agency or as a freelancer, you have probably faced similar challenges. Now there&#39;s a better way to collaborate with clients than sending documents over email. Manage all of your client interaction in one place, from the initial brainstorming of requirements to the final design sign-off.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feature-overview\">Feature overview</h3>\n<p>The first feature ReqWise offers is <strong>Questionnaires</strong>, where you can ask your stakeholders questions to get an idea for what you&#39;re supposed to build. Questionnaires can be used to supplement time-consuming meetings.</p>\n<p>ReqWise&#39;s next feature is <strong>Organizing Requirements</strong>. Arrange stakeholders&#39; needs into requirements and sub-requirements. Prioritize the most important ones.</p>\n<p>ReqWise isn&#39;t limited to text-based requirements. Upload <strong>Files and Designs</strong> from your computer or draw diagrams with the built-in editor.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you can receive <strong>Feedback and Approval</strong> from clients. Stakeholders can review requirements and designs to make sure that you build what they want.</p>\n",

The AIY voice kit listens to what you say and parses the audio into text using Google Cloud Speech API. The Raspberry Pi takes the text and, using a Python script we’ve written, converts each character into a list of curves to be drawn. For each curve, the robot positions itself at the starting point using wheels connected to two stepper motors with L393D drivers. Stepper motors were chosen because they can be controlled more precisely than regular DC motors. Once in position, the servo lowers the marker to touch the paper. The robot then follows the curve until it reaches the endpoint.</p>\n",
